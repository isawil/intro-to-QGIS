# Introduction to QGIS

This workshop will teach you some of the basics of QGIS, an open-source GIS (Geographic Information Systems) tool, using COVID-19 data.

## Getting started

### What do I need to install?

[Install QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) (Please install the long term release version--this is the most stable version, with the fewest bugs)

[Download workshop files](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/confirmed-positive-cases-of-covid-19-in-ontario) (Please download dataset titled "Confirmed positive cases of COVID19 in Ontario")

### Why QGIS?

QGIS is an open-source GIS tool. The software and all plugins are free to download. It also runs on all major operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux (Ubuntu). The community is active and friendly and the software is in constant development. QGIS is ideal when you want a program that does most of what ArcGIS does, but don't use or have access to a computer running Windows.

### Understanding vector and raster data types

While there are many kinds of spatial file types, there are two main kinds of data that you'll use when you work with GIS tools. These are called **vector** and **raster** data formats.

**Vector** data consists of points, lines, and polygons. These are discrete objects. Vector data is precise, but not always accurate.

**Raster** data consists of a collection of scalable but equally-sized cells. You can think of these as pixels on a computer screen: although they may have differing colors, every screen has a certain number of square pixels, all of which are the same size. Raster data can come in the form of a background image or basemap.
