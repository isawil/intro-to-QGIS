# Why QGIS?

Depending on how familiar you are with GIS, you may or may not have heard of QGIS. QGIS is an open-source GIS tool. The software and all plugins are free to download. It also runs on all major operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux (Ubuntu). The community is active and friendly and the software is in constant development. QGIS is ideal when you want a program that does most of what ArcGIS does, but don't use Windows.
